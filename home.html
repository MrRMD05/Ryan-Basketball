          <ol class="mainlist">
              <li id="G">GUARDS</li>
                <section>
                  <p>The positions known for their basketball IQ and craftiness on the field.</p>
                  <p>They are usually the shortest people on the court. Despite their height, they are able to maneuver their way into the driving lane and possibly get easy buckets.</p>
                  <p>There are only <strong>two types of guards</strong>.</p>
                  <h4 id="PG">POINT GUARD:</h4>
                    <p>Arguably the most essential position in the game of basketball. In comparison to our body, the PG is the brain or the mind.</p>
                    <p>This position is commonly known as the leader/facilitator of the team. The PG should be the best playmaker and ball handler on the court.</p>
                    <p>When a player in this position is gifted with vision, the player is able to dish out dimes or in other words, execute incredible plays.</p>
                  <h4 id="SG">SHOOTING GUARD:</h4>
                    <p>The SG, like in its name, <em>shooting</em>, tend to be the best shooter on the team.</p>
                    <p>Rather than being the point guard's assistant, the player in this position should be the partner that the PG can rely on.</p>
                    <p>Other than being an elite shooter, the SG should be able to run around the court in order to find the gaps or spaces the player needs to create an easy shot.</p>
                  </section> <!-- guard section -->
              <li id="F">FORWARDS</li>
                <section>
                  <p>The positions that are flexible and are able to do it all.</p>
                  <p>They are able to keep up with the guard's speed and shiftiness, yet are still capable of keeping their ground against tall centers.</p>
                  <h4 id="SF">SMALL FORWARD:</h4>
                    <p>You can't let <em>"small"</em> in this name fool you. Players in this position can also keep up with the big guys.</p>
                    <p>SF players have to be the most versatile on the court.</p>
                    <p>They dwell on the perimeter of the court(outside the free throw line, but inside the three point line). Because of that, having a good mid-range shot is essential.</p>
                  <h4 id="PF">POWER FORWARD:</h4>
                    <p>As the name suggests, players in this position are like the mitochondria of a cell because they are the powerhouse of the team.</p>
                    <p>They aren't that much different from the SFs. However, they are more involved with plays that occur near the paint.</p>
                    <p>They are responsible for grabbing rebounds and being prolific finishers. When it comes to defense, PFs should be able to lock up anybody who dares to pass the driving lane.</p>
                </section> <!-- forward section -->
              <li id="C">CENTERS</li>
                <p>Players in this position are most often the tallest because they do not allow their opponets to get easy layups. Their stature intimidates people who dare to challenge them.</p>
                <p>Footwork is key to stack up on points. They do not have to be a good shooter, although that helps in most cases. Their height is the greatest advantage since it lets them put the bucket on the hoop over people.</p>
                <p>Because of their height, they must be the go-to guy when it comes to rebounding. Setting up screens is another skill they should have since it creates easy pick and roll offense.</p>
