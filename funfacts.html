          <ol class="mainlist">
            <li>James Naismith invented basketball in 1891</li>
              <p>He invented a basketball by shooting a soccer ball to a peach basket.</p>
            <li>Filipinos enjoy watching and playing basketball</li>
              <p>The Philippines comes in 2nd in popularity for the sport. Unfortunately, there is yet to be a full-blooded Filipino in the NBA. However, if Filipinos were gifted with height, they would potentially dominate the NBA.</p>
            <li>LeBron James is already 36</li>
              <p>The <strong>king</strong> is in that age group of retirees. His career is filled with a mountain of accomplishments, yet he wishes for one thing. That is to play with his son Bronny in an NBA game. By that time, LeBron will already be 40 years old!</p>
            <li>The 3-point line wasn't implemented until 1986</li>
              <p>This fact may unbelievable to the younger generation since they are growing up with players like Stephen Curry shooting lights out from deep.</p>

            <li>All NBA jerseys are designed by Nike</li>
              <p>NBA jerseys were manufactured by Adidas before the 2017-18 season, but now it is Nike.</p>

          <h2>Why I love basketball.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Good Exercise</li>
              <p>Whenever I feel bored and unproductive, I play the sport with a group of friends. It is good exercise since it involves running around and moving your body. It improves our stamina, strength, and coordination.</p>
            <li>Fun to Play</li>
              <p>I don't know how else to say it. The sport is simply enjoyable and addicting especially with your friends. You can do a lot of things with a basketball and a hoop. Running 1v1's, 5v5's, or even a game of HORSE are only some in many types of games.</p>
            <li>Watching the Games</li>
              <p>To me, NBA games are fascinating. I get to see professionals do what they do best and learn from their playstyle. Also, watching normal people play in real life is equally as fascinating since it can get exciting.</p>
